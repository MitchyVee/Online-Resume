<h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
<p>I love gaming in VR, but also, board games, card games and adrenaline based sporting activities.</p>

<p>I have a history with Mathematics and love solving puzzles, I am keen on escape rooms and reverse engineering small household appliances.<br>
This interest is closely tied in with my love for a zero waste lifestyle, which also led to a keen interest in gardening, composting and making/altering my own clothes.</p>
